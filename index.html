        <h1>Engaging faith communities</h1>
            <br>
        <p>In light of the Brexit Referendum result along with an increase of hate crime statistics, UK Government
            formed it‚Äôs<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.publishing.service.gov.uk%2Fgovernment%2Fuploads%2Fsystem%2Fuploads%2Fattachment_data%2Ffile%2F777160%2FIntegrated_Communities_Strategy_Government_Response.pdf&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGMwrAvmc-AVqa1mUKgyjGysALiFg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Integrated Communities Strategy.</a>I designed a visual to facilitate
            discussions on how Government could increase it‚Äôs engagement with faith communities.

This resulted in a 1-page diagram.

            I identified policy gaps and potential opportunities. I identified 7 potential interventions and prioritised
            these based on the complexity of their implementation.
            <br>
            <br>
            This gave me a list of 7 next steps.
            <br>
            <br>
            One of the potential interventions was a geographically based, WhatsApp local community notice board. I
            created a prototype of what the interface might look like.

           Although community notice boards have not been implemented, the policy analysis exercise identified limitations in the government‚Äôs strategy which shifted how policy makers understood the current challenge and potential opportunities.

        <h1>Public Sector Equality Duty</h1>
            <br>
        <p>
            ‚ÄãThe Public Sector Equality Duty requires public authorities to effectively consider how their policies/ decisions affect protected characteristic communities. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Whilst working as a Town Planner in a Local Authority, I formed and led a team to work on improving my organisation's understanding of it's equalities duties. 
            <br> 
            <br>
            <b><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Equality Act 2010</a>,</b> says a public authority must have due regard to the need to:
            <br>
            <br> 
            <ol> 
                <li><b>eliminate discrimination, harassment, victimisation</b> and any other conduct that is prohibited by or under this Act;</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>advance equality of opportunity between persons</b> who share a relevant protected characteristic and persons who do not share it;</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>foster good relations</b> between persons who share a relevant protected characteristic and persons who do not share it.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <img src="images/psed-council-officers.jpeg">
            <br>
            <p>
                 I met with planning officers who worked on different parts of the planning application process. They had a range of equalities-related experiences to share. I anonymised the experiences, and wrote them up to become case studies. I planned and led a series of interactive workshops where employees were invited to consider how they might overcome the challenges raised in each case study.
            </p>
            <br>
            <img src="images/psed-planning-process.jpeg">
            <br>
            <p>
                The workshops created a safe space for experiences to be shared. It also allowed staff to learn from each other, and begin to discuss ways to move forward. An actions table was created as an open working document, that staff could add to before, during, and after the workshops.
            </p>
            <br>
            <img src="images/psed-table.jpeg">
            <br>
            <p>
                This has helped Local Authority officers to understand what their equalities duties are, and how to they can evidence doing the duties in their day-to-day practice. This way of working has helped contribute to achieving a more inclusive and reflective culture.
