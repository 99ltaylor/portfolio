            <h2>Engaging Faith Communities</h2>
            <p>In light of the Brexit Referendum result and an increase in hate crime statistics, the UK Government formed its <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.publishing.service.gov.uk%2Fgovernment%2Fuploads%2Fsystem%2Fuploads%2Fattachment_data%2Ffile%2F777160%2FIntegrated_Communities_Strategy_Government_Response.pdf&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGMwrAvmc-AVqa1mUKgyjGysALiFg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Integrated Communities Strategy</a>. I designed a visual to facilitate discussions on how the Government could increase its engagement with faith communities.</p>
            <img src="images/faith-current.jpeg">
            <p>Using Policy Lab's <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fopenpolicy.blog.gov.uk%2F2017%2F09%2F22%2Fdesigning-policy%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGJCs6qwC5IKlED__9aFC8ffImkzg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Styles of Government Intervention</a>, I adopted the model to categorise actions between different sectors currently operating within the faith integration space. This resulted in a one-page diagram.</p>
            <img src="images/faith-potential.jpeg">
            <p>I identified policy gaps and potential opportunities, outlining seven potential interventions and prioritising these based on the complexity of their implementation. This produced a list of seven next steps.</p>
            <img src="images/faith-noticeboard.jpeg">
            <p>Although community notice boards have not yet been implemented, the policy analysis exercise identified limitations in the government's strategy, thereby shifting how policymakers understand the current challenges and potential opportunities.</p>

            <h2>Public Sector Equality Duty</h2>
            <p>The Public Sector Equality Duty mandates public authorities to consider how their policies and decisions affect communities with protected characteristics. While working as a Town Planner in a Local Authority, I formed and led a team to enhance my organisation's understanding of its equalities duties.</p>
            <p><b><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Equality Act 2010</a></b> specifies that a public authority must have due regard to the need to:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Eliminate discrimination, harassment, victimisation and any other conduct that is prohibited by or under this Act;</li>
                <li>Advance equality of opportunity between persons who share a relevant protected characteristic and persons who do not share it;</li>
                <li>Foster good relations between persons who share a relevant protected characteristic and persons who do not share it.</li>
            </ol>
            <img src="images/psed-council-officers.jpeg">
            <p>I met with planning officers who had a range of equalities-related experiences to share. These experiences were anonymised and written up as case studies. I planned and led a series of interactive workshops for employees to consider how they might overcome the challenges raised in each case study.</p>
            <img src="images/psed-planning-process.jpeg">
            <p>The workshops created a safe space for sharing experiences and learning from one another, fostering discussions on potential ways forward. An action table was created as an open working document that staff could contribute to before, during, and after the workshops.</p>
            <img src="images/psed-table.jpeg">
            <p>This approach has aided Local Authority officers in understanding their equalities duties and how to evidence these in their day-to-day practice, contributing to a more inclusive and reflective culture.</p>
