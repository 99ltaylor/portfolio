            <h2>Engaging Faith Communities</h2>
            <p>In light of the Brexit Referendum result and an increase in hate crime statistics (including against particular faith and religous groups), the UK Government formed its <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.publishing.service.gov.uk%2Fgovernment%2Fuploads%2Fsystem%2Fuploads%2Fattachment_data%2Ffile%2F777160%2FIntegrated_Communities_Strategy_Government_Response.pdf&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGMwrAvmc-AVqa1mUKgyjGysALiFg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Integrated Communities Strategy </a>. I designed a visual to facilitate discussions on how Government could increase its engagement with faith communities.</p>
            <img src="images/faith-current.jpeg">
            <p>Using Policy Lab's <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fopenpolicy.blog.gov.uk%2F2017%2F09%2F22%2Fdesigning-policy%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGJCs6qwC5IKlED__9aFC8ffImkzg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Styles of Government Intervention </a>, I adapted the model to categorise actions between different sectors currently operating within the faith integration space. This resulted in a one-page diagram.</p>
            <img src="images/faith-potential.jpeg">
            <p>I identified policy gaps and potential opportunities, outlining seven potential interventions and prioritising these based on the complexity of their implementation. This resulted in a list of seven next steps including a potential product - 'Digital Community Notice Boards'.</p>
            <img src="images/faith-noticeboard.jpeg">
            <p>Although Digital Community Notice Boards have not yet been implemented, the policy analysis exercise identified limitations in Government's strategy, thereby shifting how policymakers understood the current challenges and identified potential opportunities.</p>

            <h2>Public Sector Equality Duty</h2>
            <p>The Public Sector Equality Duty mandates public authorities consider how their policies and decisions affect communities with protected characteristics. While working as an Urban Planner in a Local Authority, I led a team in developing the organisation's understanding of its equalities legislative duties.</p>
            <p><b><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Equality Act 2010</a></b> specifies that a public authority must have due regard to the need to:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Eliminate discrimination, harassment, victimisation and any other conduct that is prohibited by or under this Act;</li>
                <li>Advance equality of opportunity between persons who share a relevant protected characteristic and persons who do not share it;</li>
                <li>Foster good relations between persons who share a relevant protected characteristic and persons who do not share it.</li>
            </ol>
            <img src="images/psed-council-officers.jpeg">
            <p>I met with planning officers who had a range of equalities-related experiences to share. These experiences were anonymised and written up as case studies. I planned and led a series of interactive workshops for employees to consider how they might overcome the challenges raised in each case study.</p>
            <img src="images/psed-planning-process.jpeg">
            <p>The workshops created a safe space for sharing experiences and learning from one another, fostering discussions on potential ways forward. An Actions Table was created as an open working document that staff could contribute to before, during, and after the workshops.</p>
            <img src="images/psed-table.jpeg">
            <p>This approach has helped the Local Authority officers in understanding their equalities duties and how to evidence these in their day-to-day practice, which makes a small contributiion to having a more inclusive and reflective culture.</p>
